INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Before applying any of the ideas and files i am hoping to collect in this thread, make sure to make a safety copy of the complete qml-folder of the Traktor software, so you have the original files as a fallback in case of, you know, failure.

After that, all the files contained in the archive replace the original files.
